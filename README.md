# Gaming Service
Gaming Service is my final Coders Lab bootcamp project. I have decided to build this kind of a program because it is something different from a typical CRUD-based small business manager. Currently Gaming Service consists of only one game: Mastermind. Although my program is not a rocket-science level app, I hope you are going to return to play Mastermind once in awhile.

I have used prehistoric jsp frontend in order to present this project in a more visually appealing way than JSON.


## Technologies used in the project:
* Java 8
* Spring Boot
* Spring Security
* Spring MVC
* Spring Data
* JPQL
* Hibernate
* H2 database (for demo purposes)
* JSP
* JSTL
* Spring Forms
* Custom Validation Annotations

## Future implementation plan:
1. Achievements system
2. Admin panel for "business" purposes such as: statistics, suspicious activity...
3. Multiplayer using WebSockets
4. Battleships or a different fun to play multiplayer game
