# Gaming Service
Gaming Service is my final Coders Lab bootcamp project. I have decided to build this kind of a program because it is something different from a typical CRUD-based small business manager. Currently Gaming Service consists of only one game: Mastermind. Although my program is not a rocket-science level app, I hope you are going to return to play Mastermind once in awhile.

I have used prehistoric jsp frontend in order to present this project in a more visually appealing way than JSON.


## Technologies used in the project:
* Java 8
* Spring Boot
* Spring Security
* Spring MVC
* Spring Data

## Future implementations plan:
1. Achievements system

* Battleships or a different fun to play multiplayer game
